# Hello-Hacktoberfest-2021

- What is a branch in GitHub?<br>
You can consider a branch as your own 'working copy' of the code. 

- What is a pull request?<br>
In simple words, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to tell that their feature is compelete and can be merged with rest of the existing code.

- How to raise a PR.

1. Clone the project.
2. Create a new branch (In case using cli use `git checkout -b yourbranchname`)
3. Add a new file with your github username or a custom code of your own!
4. Git Add and commit the changes.(Incase using CLI : `git add <filename>` and `git commit -m commitmessage`)
5. Push the code! (Yay! Your first commit. Push using `git push origin yourbranchname`)
5. On the github go to a branch and create a PR using the button there!


- I would recommend using github desktop for committing your code if you are a beginner but if you want to learn cli/gitbash there are commands in the steps.

Feel Free to Contribute.
Happy #hacktoberfest
